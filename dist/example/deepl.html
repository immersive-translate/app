        What are CRDTs made from, though? It looks like typically it's some
        internal stuff, a function to resolve the internal stuff to a
        <code>value</code>, and a function to <code>merge</code> two of the data structure
        together. The <code>merge</code>
        function is the number-one-most-important thing about this whole
        arrangement, and has to satisfy1 these three laws:

      <div>分割线</div>

        These properties appeal to me! If CRDTs can automatically and
        independently converge, no matter how far apart they drift, then you
        could store them wherever and however you like.

        If all these are true, we can always merge two states, regardless of how
        many changes have been made since we last merged, and get the same
        result on both sides of the sync. Cool!
